## Description of this project
This app has two pages:
1. News List Page. This is the launch page. When starting, we will fetch the news through an API. After fetching, the news will be displayed using LiveData. By clicking on each news item, you will enter the second page. 
2. News details page: The news details page provides the news content, but due to API limitations, only a portion of the news content can be obtained (this is not a bug), so you may see something like [+1000 chars].
